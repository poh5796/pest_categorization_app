alternatively, download Expo Go "https://d1ahtucjixef4r.cloudfront.net/Exponent-2.18.8.apk" with this link to run this application because the Expo SDK used in this application is ver 40.0.0 which only supported by deprecated version of Expo Go.

In Win 10, go to "Settings" -> "Network & Internet" -> Select "Properties" of current connected network (e.g. "Jame's Family") -> In "Network Profile" section, choose "Private" if the default option is in "Public".

next, in your mobile device, go to "Settings" -> "Apps" -> "Special Access" -> "Appear on top" -> Toggle to "On" for Expo Go (Samsung Galaxy 9+)

after the steps above, use Expo Go to scan the QR code generated when the server started with "expo start" command in terminal.
